# Unsupervised_ML_Project
## Objective:
The objective of this assessment is to evaluate your understanding and ability to apply clustering techniques to a real-world dataset.

## Dataset
Use the Iris dataset available in the sklearn library.

## Key components to be fulfilled :

  ### 1. Loading and Preprocessing
    Load the Iris dataset from sklearn.
    Drop the species column since this is a clustering problem.
  ### 2.Clustering Algorithm Implementation (8 marks)
    Implement the following two clustering algorithms:
     A) KMeans Clustering
      * Provide a brief description of how KMeans clustering works.
      * Explain why KMeans clustering might be suitable for the Iris dataset.
      * Apply KMeans clustering to the preprocessed Iris dataset and visualize the clusters.
     B) Hierarchical Clustering
      * Provide a brief description of how Hierarchical clustering works.
      * Explain why Hierarchical clustering might be suitable for the Iris dataset.
      * Apply Hierarchical clustering to the preprocessed Iris dataset and visualize the clusters.
